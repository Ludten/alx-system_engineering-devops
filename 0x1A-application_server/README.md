# Application server
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates Application server
> specific to the Bash Scripting & DevOps.

## Description of what each file shows:
* Letâ€™s serve what you built for [AirBnB clone v2 - Web framework](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/projects/290) on `web-01`. This task is an exercise in setting up your development environment, which is used for testing and debugging your code before deploying it to production.

	Requirements:
	- Git clone your `AirBnB_clone_v2` on your `web-01` server.
	- Configure the file `web_flask/0-hello_route.py` to serve its content from the route `/airbnb-onepage/` on port `5000`.
	- Your Flask application object must be named `app` (This will allow us to run and check your code).
